# Compare
Hello Friend!

This is a script designed to make comparisons between multiple genomes and specific databases (CARD, BacMet and VFDB).
If you have another database in mind, feel free to send a request to dlnrodrigues@ufmg.br and we will update the code.
The figure created by the script is known as a clustermap and by default uses a Euclidean distance measure to group the data.

To use the script it is possible to use the command:

```
python3 compare.py
```

or

```
python3 compare.py -h
```

## How to get this tool?
User, you will be able to obtain this script using the simple command:
